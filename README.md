# Legacy-Edition-Glide
A port of the Glide minigame from the Legacy Editions of minecraft to Java Edition 

This is the old build I made a long while back, quite a lot of commits behind LEB at this point, it doesnt need any mods to launch, will work in vanilla

It can only handle 8 players, and do not actually let it try to load a map, it will lock up.

If you want to look at the maps, use Builder Mode, `/function 4jglide:build/start`

This build is not going to be used for anything, ever. Its just worth open sourcing it if someone ever needs it
